        <h2>📜<br/>💧 DROP 🩸</h2>
        <p>
          The moment when I opened my eyes <br/>from the nap I took<br/>not too long ago…<br/>
          I saw the burning rose like red meteor <br/>those were once the sparkling
          wish granting stars. <br/>That day the sun went down but moon never showed
          up. <br/>the burden of the talent I wore, <br/>buried me in my hopeless grave.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
          I was stuck. <br/>I was stuck in nothingness of the starry night <br/>waiting
          for return of the light. <br/>I saw a spark, a faint one. <br/>I ran towards it,
          But I was too late. <br/>It was already gone. <br/>I felt like I shouldn't have
          run this far. <br/>probably should've just stayed at home, <br/>feasting on
          cookies from the jar. <br/>I was lost, forgotten my way back home
        </p>

        <p>
          But instead of sad, <br/>the realization of being lost made me happy. <br/>I
          perceived being lost as being free. <br/>Free from the undeniable promises
          and <br/>unwritten rules. <br/>No compromises, No expectations, <br/>Running, flying
          and <br/>wandering in Strange lands. <br/>But, I slipped and injured myself. <br/>I
          never understood the same rope <br/>stopping me from flying <br/>was the one
          keeping me at my place. <br/>Suddenly the bright light emerged from the
          horizon, I saw. <br/>It was like the warm lime-orange blanket across the
          sky, <br/>lit from both sides<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
          And I, <br/>was the Kite drowning in high tides <br/>I smiled as I drown into
          the darkness of the ocean. <br/>with green colour light blocking my vision
          and my motion. <br/>Then, suddenly I woke up <br/>from the nap I took not <br/>too
          long ago. <br/>But sun didn't.
